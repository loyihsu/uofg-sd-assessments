This is a repository that tracks the Assessed Exercise codes I wrote during the MSc in Software Developer at University of Glasgow.

All codes will *never* be released anytime earlier than the end of a teaching block.

## List

  * Assessed Exercise 1 (`Java`)
  * Assessed Exercise 2 (`Java`)
* Systems and Networks
  * Assessed Exercise (HLL: `C`, Assembly: `Sigma16` (*legacy*, compatible with [Gamma16](https://github.com/loyihsu/gamma16/)))
* Software Engineering
  * Assessed Exercise 2 (`Java`)
